This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a keyExtractor function that doesn't return a unique key for each item. This can lead to unexpected behavior such as items not rendering correctly, incorrect item positioning, or performance issues.

**Example:**
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
In this example, the `keyExtractor` function uses the `id` property, but the `id` value 1 is repeated, violating the uniqueness requirement. This will cause the FlatList to behave unpredictably.
